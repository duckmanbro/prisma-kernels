# Prisma Kernels 

- **hello, i'm @prisma_droid**
  i present to you, these custom
  compiled kernels, in which i 
  added a lot of features, not 
  only to hide root better, but
  also making android/termux
  experience better.

- **features**
  docker
  lxc
  susfs
  ksun, sukisu, resukisu
  better spoof

- keep in mind that (YOU FLASHED THIS!)
  i'm not responsible for thermonuclear wars,
  bricked software, bootlooped devices.

  from the moment you flash this, you guarantee
  that you know what you are doing, so it's better
  if you know how to avoid bootloop.

- **AnyKernel3**
  i decided to use anykernel3.
  the reasons being:
   - it's easier to maintain
   - it's easier to flash
   - i got to personalize as i want.

- **⚠️  READ THIS  ⚠️**
  🚫 DONT PATCH KPM (if you are flashing through KSU MANAGER)
